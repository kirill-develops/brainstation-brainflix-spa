# BrainFlix
### React.js app


*is a YouTube emulator created during the Web Development bootcamp @BrainStation*

With a 3 week timeframe broken into 3 sprints, we built out the front-end React SPA using create-react-app, react-router and Sass. During sprint 2 we built on state & data fetching concepts by leveraging class components and integrating Axios into Reactâ€™s lifecycle methods. Finally we complemented the site with a Node/Express API server following a MVC architecture to separate concerns and scalability.

Below you can find instructions on how to install the React.js front-end app. If you havenâ€™t already, please install the back-end Node/Express API server first. [Click here](https://github.com/kirill-develops/kirill-tchentsov-brainflix-api) to find the repo and installation instructions.

Thank you for stopping by! ðŸŽ¥ðŸŒŸ
